Hi, I'm  Yogeswar Reddy 👋
Software Engineer
I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and SQL. Currently, I'm diving deep into the Elixir ecosystem, working on real estate CRM solutions using Elixir, Phoenix, Ash, and PostgreSQL. My goal is to leverage my skills across diverse domains in software development, continuously learning and adapting to new technologies.
